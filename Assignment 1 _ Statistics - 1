1. You survey households in your area to find the average rent they are paying. Find the
   standard deviation from the following data:
   
   $1550, $1700, $900, $850, $1000, $950.
   
Solution:

def find_mean(arr):
    return sum(arr)/len(arr)
    
def find_variance(arr):
    variance = 0.0
    from math import sqrt
    mean = find_mean(arr)
    variance = sum((x - mean)**2 for x in arr) / (len(arr)-1)
    return variance
    
def find_std_dev(arr):
    return find_variance(arr)**0.5
    
arr = [1550,1700,900,850,1000,950]

Using Custom Method:

print("Average Rent households paying: " + str(find_mean(arr)))
print("Standard Deviation of the rent households paying: " + str(find_std_dev(arr)))

Using statistics library:

import statistics as stat
print(str("Average Rent households paying: " + str(stat.mean(arr))))
print(str("Standard Deviation of the rent households paying: " + str(stat.stdev(arr))))
