Find the variance for the following set of data representing trees in California (heights in feet):
3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9

Solution:

def find_mean(arr):
    return sum(arr)/len(arr)
    
def find_variance(arr):
    variance = 0.0
    from math import sqrt
    mean = find_mean(arr)
    variance = sum((x - mean)**2 for x in arr) / (len(arr)-1)
    return variance
    
arr = [3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9]

Using Custom Method:

print("Variance for heights of trees in California: " + str(find_variance(arr)))

Using statistics library:

import statistics as stat
print(str("Variance for heights of trees in California: " + str(stat.variance(arr))))
