In a class on 100 students, 80 students passed in all subjects, 10 failed in one subject, 7
failed in two subjects and 3 failed in three subjects. Find the probability distribution of
the variable for number of subjects a student from the given class has failed in.

Solution:

Total number of students n = 100

Let x be number of students failed in â€“ random variable

For a random student,

The probability of failing in 0 subjects, P(X=0) = 80/100 = 0.8
The probability of failing in 1 subjects, P(X=1) = 10/100 = 0.1
The probability of failing in 2 subjects, P(X=2) = 7/100 = 0.07
The probability of failing in 3 subjects, P(X=3) = 3/100 = 0.03

The probability distribution can be shown as:

 X	    0	    1	    2	     3
 P(X)	 0.8	 0.1	 0.07	  0.03
